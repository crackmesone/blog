It's hard to believe this actually happened.

Back in the summer of 2025, I started thinking about organizing a CTF for the crackmes.one community. We have such a passionate community of reverse engineers - why not bring everyone together for a week of friendly competition? Inspired by the legendary [Flare-On challenge](https://Flare-On.com/) that every reverse engineer knows and loves, we wanted to create a **pure RE competition** with carefully crafted binaries and creative puzzles.

Fast forward to February 2026, and here we are. **The first-ever crackmes.one CTF has concluded**, and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out.

## The Event

The CTF ran for one week, from **February 14 to February 21, 2026**. We hosted the competition on [CTFd](https://crackmesone.ctfd.io/) during the event, and the permanent home for all CTF-related information will remain at [ctf.crackmes.one](https://ctf.crackmes.one/).

We put together **12 challenges** spanning various difficulty levels and themes - from custom VMs and shellcode analysis to JIT decryption with nanomites and DRM reversing. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, there was something for everyone.

By the end of the week:

- **X** players registered
- **Y** completed all 12 challenges
- **Z** solved at least one challenge

These numbers are beyond what I expected for our first run.

**Missed the event or didn't finish all the challenges?** Check out the [challenges and official writeups on GitHub](https://github.com/crackmesone/ctf-2026-challenges-public).

**Note:** We're keeping the [CTFd instance](https://crackmesone.ctfd.io/) running until the end of February. Act quickly if you want to take screenshots of your progress!

## Prizes

![Top 10 Scoreboard](/assets/images/top10-scoreboard.png)

The **top 5 players** - **quocbao21**, **august**, **hexamine**, **crazyman**, and **ddjjdd640** - walked away with licenses for [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) - the reverse engineering platform that needs no introduction.

Players ranked **6th to 10th** - **darbonzo**, **slightly**, **0nid**, **ELJoOker**, and **np** - received [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) licenses - because every reverse engineer deserves to finally register their copy.

The **top 100 players** are now immortalized in our [Hall of Fame](https://ctf.crackmes.one/#hall-of-fame) - a permanent recognition of their skills and dedication.

### Best Writeup Prize

## Thank You

I have to give credit where it's due.

[**Elvis**](https://elvisblue.github.io/) and [**lumi**](https://lumiingenii.ch/) co-organized this event with me, and honestly, they did more work than I did. From drafting the CTF plan, to pinging challenge authors to make sure they finished on time, to monitoring tickets during the competition - they made this happen. Thank you both.

To our challenge authors:

- [**sar**](https://crackmes.one/) - the creator and former admin of crackmes.one. Without sar, this community wouldn't exist.
- [**Moritz**](https://cloud.google.com/security/flare) - from the FLARE team at Google Cloud, the team behind the legendary [Flare-On](https://Flare-On.com/) reverse engineering challenges. Having his contributions meant a lot to us.
- [**crudd**](https://bsky.app/profile/crudd.re) - a long-time member of our community who continues to give back.

A huge thanks also to our other challenge authors: [**daax**](https://revers.engineering/), [**Ben_Lolo**](https://benlolo.me), [**Reisen_1943**](https://anduinbrian.github.io/), [**Fatmike**](https://github.com/Fatmike-GH), [**toasterbirb**](https://github.com/toasterbirb), and [**heapsoverflow**](https://github.com/0x1c1101) - your challenges made this event what it was.

And of course, thank you to everyone who participated. You are the reason this community thrives.

## See You Next Year

We're already thinking about the next one.

**Mark your calendars for February 2027.** We'll be back with more challenges, more competition, and hopefully even more participants.
